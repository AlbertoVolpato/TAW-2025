# Route Management Architecture Test

## Summary
Successfully migrated route management from admin module to airline module per requirements:
- "Routes management (Airlines only)"

## Architecture Changes Made

### Backend ✅ (Already Correct)
- `/api/routes` endpoints: Require airline authentication
- JWT middleware: `authorize('airline')` on all route operations
- Airline-specific filtering: Routes filtered by authenticated airline user

### Frontend Changes ✅ (Completed)

#### 1. Created Airline Route Management Module
- Path: `/frontend/src/app/modules/airline/components/route-management/`
- New component: `AirlineRouteManagementComponent`
- Route: `/airline/routes`
- Role guard: `expectedRole: 'airline'`

#### 2. Removed Admin Route Management  
- Deleted: `/frontend/src/app/modules/admin/components/route-management/`
- Deleted: `/frontend/src/app/modules/admin/components/route-dialog/`
- Removed route: `/admin/routes`
- Removed navigation link from admin dashboard

#### 3. Updated Services
- RouteService: Added airline-specific methods
  - `getAirlineRoutes()`
  - `createAirlineRoute()`
  - `updateAirlineRoute()`  
  - `deleteAirlineRoute()`

#### 4. Updated Navigation
- Added "Gestisci Rotte" card to airline dashboard
- Links to `/airline/routes` with airline role guard

## API Verification ✅

### Airline Routes API Test (Token: Alitalia)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/routes" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Result: 23 routes for Alitalia - ✅ Working

curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/routes" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{...}'
# Result: Successfully created AZ999 route - ✅ Working
```

## Architectural Compliance ✅

### Requirements Check:
- ✅ "Routes management (Airlines only)" - Routes now managed by airline users only
- ✅ Admin no longer has route management access
- ✅ Airline users have dedicated route management interface
- ✅ Backend properly enforces airline-only access with JWT middleware
- ✅ Frontend role guards prevent unauthorized access

### Security Model:
- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control (airline/admin/user)
- ✅ Airline-specific data filtering
- ✅ Route management isolated to airline users

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

The architectural issue has been resolved:
- Route management moved from admin to airline module
- Backend was already correctly configured
- Frontend now matches the requirements
- All authentication and authorization working correctly
